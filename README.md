# Project-Listing
:pushpin:My first listing website made to showcase my skills to my College for getting selected for the web development intern posistion for developing our college blog site

:pushpin: Atlast i get shortlisted but the thing is placements preparation stopped me to going deeper through the web development

:pushpin:So the blog site preparation by students for our college has been dropped 

:o: However the things gone i managed to learn more about frontend development 

:trophy:You can view my site in the https://askus.netlify.app/index.html which is hosted by me in the netlify environment:trophy:
